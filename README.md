# The Big PCB Project

Welcome to **The Big PCB Project** ‚Äì a totally logical journey where I combine my passion for electronics with unrealistic beliefs!

## üõ†Ô∏è What is this?

This project is me, going full mad scientist mode:  
- Taking inspiration from past PCBs I‚Äôve built  
- Adding more components  
- Then more  
- Then *even more* until this PCB is absolutely massive (and probably unmanufacturable)

The goal? Build something like **The Thing** ‚Äì the ultimate PCB Frankenstein.

## üß© Why?

Because I can.  


## üß™ What will be in here? 

- Schematic files (.sch)
- Board layout files (.pcb)
- Parts list / BOM
- Versioned chaos
- Chess log
- [Schematic Link](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=57cd4cf6bf704c8bab69746f71d15acf) (probally cannot access it)
- [PCB Link](https://easyeda.com/editor#id=57cd4cf6bf704c8bab69746f71d15acf|faf1c3b9d2f243a3b150773973d005a1) (same thing)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is probably not the most efficient or practical PCB design. It's a personal project fueled by stubbornness, and the thrill of adding *just one more IC*.



Ps this is the first README i actually put time into....
