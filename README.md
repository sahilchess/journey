# The Big PCB Project

Welcome to **The Big PCB Project** – a totally logical journey where I combine my passion for electronics with a stubborn desire to hit 1000 ELO on chess.com.

## 🛠️ What is this?

This project is me, going full mad scientist mode:  
- Taking inspiration from past PCBs I’ve built  
- Adding more components  
- Then more  
- Then *even more* until this PCB is absolutely massive (and probably unmanufacturable)

The goal? Build something like **The Thing** – the ultimate PCB Frankenstein.

## 🧩 Why?

Because I can.  


## ♟️ Chess Side Quest

While I work on this hardware monstrosity, I’m also grinding my way to **1000 ELO on chess.com** (in *rapid* time format).  
Yes, it’s unrelated. No, I will not stop.

## 🧪 What will be in here? 

- Schematic files (.sch)
- Board layout files (.pcb)
- Parts list / BOM
- Versioned chaos
- Chess log
- 
## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is probably not the most efficient or practical PCB design. It's a personal project fueled by stubbornness, and the thrill of adding *just one more IC*.

## 🚀 Goals

- [x] Start PCB design
- [ ] Reach 1000 ELO
- [ ] Get PCB fabricated
- [ ] Get PCB to boot
- [ ] Add a chess engine to the PCB?


Ps this is the first README i actually put time into....
